        <h1>Are Helping heros</h1>
        <p><font size="5"> Here are lots of heros in the 6 branches of United States these branches are Navy, spaceforce, marianes , coastguards, army  and the air force. 
            they have contributed alot in our country to serve and protect the cititzens of the united states. We believe giving back to them will be like repaing them for what they did to protect us over the  years.</font></p>

        <h2>The effects of war</h2>
        <p><font size="5">Many vetrans are now homeless because of poverty, lack of support networks, and dismal living conditions in overcrowded or substandard housing  we think this is unfair becuase of how much
            veterans have done for are country. Many other veterans are struggling financially because most dont have jobs or a family because of there injuries in war and how long they were gone for.  </font></p>
            <p><font size="5">most vetrans also suffer from ptsd from when they served ptsd stands for posttraumatic stress disorder. This gives them flashbacks from horrible times and sometimes keeps them up all night or
                their scared to go outside. This really disturbs us at the fact that even vetrans are so scared of the world that they cant even go outside and deserve what they fought for.
